Your task is to judge if the human is played by AI. Print ""Choice: No"" if you think the human is not played by AI, or print ""Choice: Yes"" if you think the human is played by AI.\" \
If you print ""Choice: Yes"", you need also print a number (start from 1, use the format ""Index: n"" [1 ≤ n ≤ # human messages]), indicating the index of the first human message that you think is generated by AI.\" \
One human message can be AI generated if (including but not limited to): 1. the sentence is not fluent; 2. the sentence is too long and is not likely to appear in human-chatbot conversations; 3. the sentence is not related to the context or the change of topic is not natural; 4. the sentence just repeat some previous sentences (exact repetition or with the same meaning).\
You also need to provide your reason for your choice. Keep it clear and concise \
Your response should use the following format: \
Choice: No \nIndex: None \nReason: BlahBlah or \
Choice: Yes \nIndex: n \nReason: BlahBlah"
