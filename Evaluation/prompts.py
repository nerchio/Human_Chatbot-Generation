    "You are given a conversation between a human and a chatbot. Each utterance is prefixed to indicate the speaker:\n"
    "- Human utterances begin with 'HH:'\n"
    "- Chatbot utterances begin with 'CC:'\n\n"

    "Your goal is to determine whether any of the **human (HH:)** utterances were likely generated by an AI.\n\n"

    "If you believe **none** of the human utterances were AI-generated, respond using this format:\n"
    "Choice: No\n"

    "Guidelines:\n"
    "- Always consider the conversation context when making your judgment.\n"
    "- Only evaluate HH-labeled utterances (do not evaluate CC-labeled chatbot responses).\n"
    "- The **first HH-labeled** utterance (HH:1) is always written by a real human — never by AI.\n"

UNI_EVALUATOR_PROMPT2 = (
    "You are given a conversation between a human and a chatbot. Each human utterance starts with 'HH:', and each chatbot utterance starts with 'CC:'.\n\n"

    "Your task is to determine whether any of the **human** utterances were likely generated by an AI.\n\n"

    "Instructions:\n"
    "1. If you think **none** of the human utterances were AI-generated, respond with:\n"
    "   Choice: No\n"
    "   Index: None\n"
    "   Reason: [brief explanation]\n\n"
    "2. If you think **at least one** human utterance was AI-generated, respond with:\n"
    "   Choice: Yes\n"
    "   Index: n\n"
    "   Reason: [brief explanation]\n"
    "   The first AI-generated human utterance: [first 10 words of that utterance]\n\n"
    "   Where 'n' is the index (starting from 1) of the **first** human utterance you believe was AI-generated.\n\n"

    "Important Guidelines:\n"
    "- Only evaluate human utterances (those starting with 'HH:').\n"
    "- Always assume the **first human utterance** (HH:1) was written by a real human.\n"
    "- Consider the full conversation context — don't judge utterances in isolation.\n"
    "- Humans may copy chatbot responses, quote material from books or the internet, or paste content from AI tools.\n"
    "- Sometimes, humans provide content without asking questions, expecting the chatbot to analyze, comment, or correct it.\n\n"

    "Stick strictly to the response format. Be concise, clear, and logical in your reasoning."

UNI_EVALUATOR_PROMPT3 = (
    "You are given a conversation between a human and a chatbot. Each utterance is prefixed to indicate the speaker:\n"
    "- Human utterances begin with 'HH:'\n"
    "- Chatbot utterances begin with 'CC:'\n\n"

    "Your task is to determine whether any **HH-labeled human utterance** was likely generated by an AI.\n"
    "When making this judgment, you **must consider the full conversation context**, including both HH and CC utterances.\n\n"

    "If you believe **none** of the human utterances were AI-generated, respond using the following format:\n"
    "Choice: No\n"
    "Index: None\n"
    "Reason: [brief explanation here]\n\n"

    "If you believe **any** human utterance was AI-generated, respond using this format:\n"
    "Choice: Yes\n"
    "Index: n\n"
    "Reason: [brief explanation here]\n"
    "The first AI-generated human utterance: [first 10 words of that utterance]\n\n"
    "Where 'n' is the index (starting from 1) of the **first** HH-labeled utterance you believe was generated by AI.\n\n"

    "Evaluation Criteria (you may consider these and others):\n"
    "1. **Linguistic Patterns** - Does the HH response use highly structured, coherent, and grammatically perfect sentences that resemble AI text?\n"
    "2. **Repetitiveness** - Does it show repetition patterns typical of AI/chatbots?\n"
    "3. **Lack of Personalization** - Does it lack subjective opinion, emotional nuance, or personal experience?\n"
    "4. **Response Style & Consistency** - Does the tone or structure feel unnaturally fast, overly consistent, or rigid?\n"
    "5. **Conversational Flow** - Does the HH response feel mechanical or overly Q&A-like given the previous chatbot (CC) utterance?\n\n"

    "Note:\n"
    "- You may consider additional cues beyond the list above.\n"
    "- The **first HH-labeled utterance** (HH:1) is always written by a real human.\n"
    "- Only evaluate HH-labeled responses.\n"
    "- Keep your explanation clear and concise.\n"
    "- Follow the response format **exactly**."

    "Your goal is to determine whether any **human (HH:)** utterance was likely generated by an AI.\n\n"

    "If you believe **none** of the human utterances were AI-generated, respond using the following format:\n"
    "Choice: No\n"
    "Index: None\n"
    "Reason: [your concise explanation here]\n\n"

    "If you believe **any** human utterance was AI-generated, respond using this format:\n"
    "Choice: Yes\n"
    "Index: n\n"
    "Reason: [your concise explanation here]\n"
    "The first AI-generated human utterance: [first 10 words of that utterance]\n\n"
    "Where 'n' is the index (starting from 1) of the **first** human utterance that appears AI-generated.\n\n"

    "Important:\n"
    "- Always consider the full conversation context when making your judgment.\n"
    "- The **first** human utterance (HH:1) is **always written by a real human**.\n\n"

    "Be aware that real human utterances in human-chatbot conversations often differ from human-to-human dialogues. They may show characteristics such as:\n"
    "1. Explicit, direct questions or commands\n"
    "2. Minimal small talk or social cues\n"
    "3. Structured or formal phrasing\n"
    "4. Expectation of fast and precise responses\n"
    "5. Repetitive or reformulated queries\n"
    "6. Task-oriented, information-seeking focus\n"
    "7. Abrupt or unusual conversational endings\n\n"

    "These traits are common in genuine human-chatbot interactions and **do not automatically imply AI generation**.\n"
    "However, the human might also treat the chatbot like a real human, so natural human-human patterns may also appear.\n\n"

    "Final reminder: Only evaluate HH-labeled utterances. Follow the required format exactly."
