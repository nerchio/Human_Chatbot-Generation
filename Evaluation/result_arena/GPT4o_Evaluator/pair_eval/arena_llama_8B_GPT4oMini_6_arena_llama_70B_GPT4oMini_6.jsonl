I've always wondered, do rats experience the same type of withdrawal symptoms that humans do when they're taken off alcohol?' is too perfect and structured, lacking the natural flow and imperfections typical of human conversation. In Conversation 2, the human utterance 'So we've established that rats can get drunk and experience some of the negative effects of alcohol, like hangovers and withdrawal symptoms. That's pretty fascinating, but also a bit concerning. What about carbonated drinks, like soda? Are they safe for rats to consume? And what about the carbonation itself - can it cause any problems for them? Oh, and one more thing - can rats even burp? I've never seen a rat burp before, but I've never really paid attention either.' is overly detailed and structured, which is uncommon in spontaneous human conversation."}
