In contrast, Conversation 2's human utterances flow more naturally and resemble typical human-bot interactions."}
{"choice": "Both", "reason": "Both conversations exhibit AI-generated human utterances. In Conversation 1, the human's request for the bot to adopt a human personality is overly structured and lacks natural human phrasing.
